# Ed Jun's Project Portfolio

Welcome to my public repository! This repo will serve as a collection of my assignments, projects, and, in the future, my personal website. It's a work in progress as I continue to learn and develop my skills.

## Purpose

This repository has been created for:

- **Projects**: Personal and academic projects that showcase my skills and growth over time.
- **Future Personal Website**: I plan to add a personal website to this repo later, which will serve as my professional portfolio.
